With certain combinations of resolution/UI scale the notifications area overlaps with the lens tool. If that is the case for you try out the compatibility version of this mod: [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886957094]Notifications not over Outliner (compatibility version)[/url]\n\nCompatible with [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884035975]\"More Spreadsheets\"[/url] (thanks to inch4tk for the help). Load this mod after \"More Spreadsheets\".\n\nCompatible with [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883625242]\"Notifications Filter\"[/url].",
