[h1]Origin Mod[/h1]
[b]Production Method Auto Conversion[/b]
[olist]
	[*]Automatically convert production methods of the buildings that you just conquered.
	[*]Just convert PM that is used [b]majorly[/b] in your country (over 90%).
	[*]The auto conversion only happens to the newly acquired states right after conquering.
[/olist]

[b]merge subject[/b]
Allow you to annex your subject through a diplomatic actions.


[h1]My Work[/h1]
[olist]
	[*]List a excel for the production methods, for future development (Such as mod buildings).
	[*]The auto conversion can happens to the country you just annexed.
	[*]And now annex your subject should pay some [b]infamy[/b] and need some condition:
		base               -50
		has truce          -50
		friendly relations  50
		use obligation      50
		So if have truce, you need both friendly relations (80) and use obligation; if not, then one of it.
	[*]To allow you to get obligation even if you have vassalled them, I have to change the bankroll action.

	[b]New update[/b]:
	[*]Allow ai to annex their subject of three types : dominion, puppet and vassal (so protectorate and tributary is not allowed for ai). However, GBR, SPA, NET are exception, for balance.
	[*][b]German_Unification event is also taken into consideration[/b].

	[b]New update 2[/b]:
	[*]The protection for GBR, SPA, NET's subject now apply to the particular countries, so they can also annex the subject they get in later game.
	[*]Increase the ai weight for BIC in [b]Doctrine_Of_Lapse_Decision[/b], and reduce the infamy for ai by half. And to avoid the subject of BIC to become GBR's direct subject, decrease the ai weight for british_raj_decision to 0.
	[*]AI will more willing to bankroll their subject in order to annex them.
	[*][strike]The subsidy set can also auto convert[/strike] (Now there is a bug). But it seem to be no key word for auto_expand so I can do nothing.

	[b]New update 3[/b]:
	[*]Xizang now owe a favor to GreatQing at game start.
	[*]I finally find that the reason of the early found of british raj, is sepoy mutiny event. So I remove the change in GER's decision, but edit the sepoy mutiny journal entries.

	[b]New update 4[/b]:
	[*]I make a decision that allow you to auto subsidy [b]all[/b] the buildings on where you get further.
	[*]Now AI will always agree to annex when your infamy is above 900 :)
